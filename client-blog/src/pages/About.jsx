                I am a dedicated full-stack engineer with a strong preference for the <strong>MERN stack</strong>â€”MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. 
                However, my commitment to growth has led me to explore C# and ASP.NET. 
                I possess a profound appreciation for both the front-end and back-end aspects of web development.
            </p>
            <p className={`${theme === 'light' ? 'text-neutral-600' : 'text-neutral-200'} text-lg`}>
                In particular, I find immense satisfaction in the creative process of designing user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing websites. 
                Among my favorite technologies are <strong>React, Python, and Tailwind</strong>, which I consider invaluable tools in my repertoire. 
                I am committed to continuous learning and actively share my knowledge with fellow enthusiasts.
            </p>
            <p className={`${theme === 'light' ? 'text-neutral-600' : 'text-neutral-200'} text-lg`}>
                Additionally, I harbor a profound interest in <strong>deep learning and artificial intelligence</strong>, 
                which fuels my passion for the ever-evolving field of technology. 
                Join me on this journey as we delve into the realm of innovation and discovery.
